                        Commissioned by Brooklands Museum I developed this game which comprises eight mini games.<br><br>
                        Each mini-game represents a different stage in the airplane manufacturing process to go alongside the Award Winning Brooklands Aircraft Factory Exhibition.<br><br>
                        Within the education sector the video game industry is growing rapidly as a fun, creative and original way to learn. If the audience enjoys playing the game, they are more likely to remember the information. With this in mind I designed a game specifically for children aged 8 to12. To enhance their museum experience.<br><br>
                        This mobile game uses Unity and C# and developed for both Apple iOS and Android devices.

                        This project has been programmed in C++ and supports a 3D environment using the OpenGL framework.<br><br>
                        The architecture of the game engine is a component entity system.<br><br>
                        The game engine has many built in features such as: mesh renderer, texture renderer, input handler, static mesh collision, box collision, sound handler, orthographic GUI capabilities plus many more...<br><br>
                        Here is a video demonstration of a simple game built to show off the engine.<br><br>

                        This project is programmed in C++ using SDL2.<br><br>
                        The user places the start (green) and end (red) nodes of the path. The Ai will then produce a path using the selected algorithm.<br><br>
                        The pathfinding algorithms included are: Breadth First, Depth First, Best First and A*.<br><br>
                        The agent will then travel along the given path to its destination. This is shown by the white dots. Squares with a blue outline have been searched.<br><br>
                        Walls can be placed (yellow squares) as well as water (blue squares). Walls cannot be walked through and water adds an extra movement cost therefore avoided if a cheaper path is available (only in A*).

                        Ray tracing is a rendering technique used to generate images.<br><br>
                        A ray is traced from the imaginary eye to each pixel in the scene, calculating the colour of the pixel.<br><br>
                        Multithreading and spatial partitioning have been implemented into this project to increase rendering times.<br><br>
                        This ray tracer features: Diffuse Lighting, Ambient Lighting, Specular Lighting, Reflections and Shadows.

                        As the player runs through the forest they must dodge not only trees, but the living dead... zombies.<br><br>
                        The player is only equipped with a hand gun with limited ammunition.<br><br>
                        "Pick ups" such as ammo packs can be found throughout the forest helping the player fight for their survival.

                        The player aims and shoots the endless waves of skeletons by using the mobile phones gyroscope.<br><br>
                        As the game is played the player will accumulate skulls. These can be used in the shop to purchase new bow colours.<br><br>
                        If the score is high enough it is added to the leaderboard rankings.<br><br>
                        The second mini game uses the accelerometer in order to control an arrow's position.<br><br>
                        The player must swerve around the human obsticals and collect the skulls.

            <p>With a “can-do” attitude and equipped with common sense, given a task and a deadline, I will get the job done.<br><br>
                My technical expertise shines when developing quick turnaround proof of concepts, internal and external demos or working on cutting-edge R&D innovations.<br><br>
                Away from development, I truly enjoy engaging with the customers. My high energy and enthusiasm helps build strong and lasting relationships, fostering trust and collaboration. By leveraging these relationships, I ensure a deep understanding of the customers' requirements, assist with software integration and guarantee their satisfaction with the final solution.<br><br>
                On top of this, I have honed the ability to think on my feet - an essential skill for any presales engineer. I am always ready to tackle any challenge that may come my way, whether it's organising the conversion of a demo undercover 'police car' or devising a quick fix while on site with a customer. These challenges keep the job exciting and allow me to think creatively, making every day different and engaging.<br><br>
                Outside of work and away from the computer, I stay extremely active and love outdoor activities like running, cycling, paddleboarding, practising yoga and playing football. I'm also known for my adventurous side, which includes mountain climbing, skydiving and the occasional bungee jump!<br><br>
